# Investigating Netflix Movies

In this project, I applied Python skills to answer a real-world question.
I aimed to discover if Netflix's movies were getting shorter over time using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.
Applying  exploratory data analysis (EDA) and Data visualization.

For instance:
🗺️ Explore: How much variety exists in Netflix's offering? Base this on three variables: type, country, and listed_in.
📊 Visualize: Build a word cloud from the movie and TV shows descriptions. Make sure to remove stop words!
🔎 Analyze: Has Netflix invested more in certain genres (see listed_in) in recent years? What about certain age groups (see ratings)?
